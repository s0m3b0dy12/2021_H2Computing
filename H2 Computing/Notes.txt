Conversion

```
    if 0 <= rem <= 9:
      hex = str(rem) + hex 
    elif rem == 10:
      hex = "A" + hex 
    elif rem == 11:
      hex = "B" + hex 
    elif rem == 12:
      hex = "C" + hex 
    elif rem == 13:
      hex = "D" + hex 
    elif rem == 14:
      hex = "E" + hex 
    elif rem == 15:
      hex = "F" + hex 
```

can be simplified as

'else:
      hex =  chr((ord('A') + rem - 10) + hex'
